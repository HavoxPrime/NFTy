<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Marketplace](./public/images/marketplace.png)

NFT stands for non-fungible tokens. NFTs exist on the blockchain, which is a public ledger that records transactions. An NFT is created from digital objects that represent both tangible and intangible items, such as Art, Gifs, Music etc. Essentially, NFT are digital collectors items,. Think baseball cards but digital. They are popular because they are on the blockchain so they can only have one owner at a time and they are nearly impossible to copy.

NFT's are blowing up the digital art and collectable world. Digital art and collectables market has started to explode thanks to the blockchains.
The recent boom in the NFT opened a space for new online marketplaces for artists and collectors to buy and sell NFTs.

NFTy was created to give creators and investors the ability to sell and buy exclusively digital objects that range from funky 3D videos to images of famous tweets and everything in between.

What does NFTy bring to the Marketplace?

- We have created a platform that is easy to access all you need is a login to view and sell NFTs
- All Prices are listed in US dollars opposed to cryptocurrency, making it accessible for first time users
- Our application is responsive so users can buy and sell anywhere!
